<h2>Tennis🎾</h2>
<p>
	I play tennis 2 to 3 times a week, I have 1h30 of lessons then on weekends I play make matches against friends.
    Recently, I have resumed tournaments, and perform quite well, hoping to continue.

    <h2>Travels🌍</h2>
    <p>
    	My first big trip was Hong Kong, where I went to see my cousins.
        But my two best trips were my safari in Tanzania, it was extraordinary.
        And the discovery of all of Argentina and part of Brazil, it was magical.
